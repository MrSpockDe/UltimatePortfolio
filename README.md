## Purpose
This program can be used to collect **issues**. This does not mean, that it can only be used for **issue** with the sense of a *problem*, but it can be any posting that can be considered "open" or "closed".

## Tools
The program is developed on a MacBook Pro using XCode and SWIFT, including SwiftUI.

## Credits
Thank you to Paul Hudson (twostrwas) @https://github.com/twostraws . He is the creator of the original UltimatePortfolio App, that I have adapted.
